# 🧱 Oxidize

Oxidize is a personal project where I’m building a **Minecraft-like sandbox game** from the ground up in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
The goal isn’t to create a full game clone — it’s to explore and experiment with **performance-oriented techniques**, modern rendering strategies, and low-level optimizations in a complex, interactive world.

## 🌍 Project Goals

- 🧠 **Learn & Experiment**  
  This project is a playground for testing ideas, learning how voxel engines work, and improving my understanding of performance-critical systems in Rust.

- ⚡ **Optimize Everything**  
  From chunk generation to rendering pipelines, the focus is on squeezing out every bit of efficiency. I want to explore different data structures, caching strategies, memory layouts, and rendering methods.

- 🧱 **Build It Myself**  
  Rather than relying on existing game engines, this is about understanding how the core systems behind voxel games actually work — terrain generation, mesh building, chunk updates, and world simulation.

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision

This isn’t meant to become a commercial game — it’s an evolving **learning project**. Over time, I plan to:

- Implement different world generation and rendering techniques  
- Profile and optimize bottlenecks  
- Experiment with parallelism
